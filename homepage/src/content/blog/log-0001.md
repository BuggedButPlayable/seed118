## Pilot

### Minecraft

Minecraft was a factory game for me long before “factory games” were really a genre.

With Minecraft - and later mods like IndustrialCraft - I fell in love with building workflows, automating them, and continuously refining them. A setup is never simply “done”; it gets iterated on, simplified, and scaled. I was hooked.

### Flyff

A second moment came years later when I stumbled back onto Flyff, an old MMORPG I played a lot as a kid. To my surprise, it was released as a web version at some point (roughly 2022). I was genuinely stunned: a full MMORPG running in the browser.

Back then, I had little web development knowledge - and honestly not much interest in it either - but the idea that this was possible stuck with me. The only logical next steps was to start working as an freelancer and since a few yeaer fulltime as an webdeveloper.

### Shapez

It’s no secret that Shapez is an inspiration for S.E.E.D 118. It’s less about specific implementation details and more about the calm, low-pressure gameplay loop.

### S.E.E.D 118

S.E.E.D 118 is the result of these influences – and at the same time my attempt to learn something new.

The project is completely open source: the game and website can be viewed on GitHub. Each stable version is published as a release so that you can test the current build and provide feedback. Anyone who is interested is welcome to contribute.

A few things up front: I have a clear idea of where I want the game to go. And certain areas—especially parts of the lore—are deliberately only published to a limited extent. Nevertheless, I am open to suggestions and improvements.
